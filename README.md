## About The Project 

The project is a clean monorepo. The backend serves the frontend, frontend calls the backend, backend writes to db, so on. They are standalone apps to the extent that their variables do not depend on each other. (Right now, they do).

It is written with a Flask/Python restful backend API, a database driver to MongoDB Atlas, and a React/Typescript CRA frontend.

<br />

Scripts in root `package.json` implement Yarn workspaces only to run development-specific scripts from root assuming all backend/frontend-specific configs have been set up.

<summary>On the whole monorepo thing </summary>
> **Note:** Scripts in root `package.json` implement Yarn workspaces only to run development-specific scripts from root assuming all backend/frontend-specific configs have been set up. Running `yarn` from root has not yet been tested. For the meantime, `cd`ing to frontend and installing the React-App is the minimal reliable option to develop the app with a fixed and unchanging backend API. The backend `package.json` is solely for running python scripts from root. Backend API and data layer are superuser-specific given the production deployment, although local env variables are described in case anyone wants to locally serve a Mongo Atlas connection string from scratch. To be updated.

### Wireframes
#### Concept

The project can be understood as a library of user-created <em><b>Albums</b></em> or <em><b>Playlists</b></em> with the ability to organize, query and add <em><b>items</b></em> or <em><b>tracks</b></em> to those collections

### Design
#### Accordion Cards

- A consistent border is applied to all nodes with dynamic content. These discrete borders are designed to convey the scale of snippet item relative to a collection. These containers only vary in spacing and height and are responsible for visually conveying open and closed states of ***snippets in collections of snippets***.
#### Theme

- Chakra-UI's `ThemeProvider` wraps the app in order to pass styles down the component tree. See [Chakra-UI](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/theming/theme).

#### Colors
- The app features two sets of neutral tones for light mode and dark mode. Tones are applied to backgrounds while borders are rendered to highlight items and convey feedback. Tones are minimally set to three values within `#fafafa` and `#010f08` in order to reserve state-changes to border sizes and scales.

## Features
### Existing Features

#### User Registration
- The website features the ability to `sign up`, `sign in` and `sign out` in order to conditionally access existing features. A user is based on the `user` model, which requires `username`, `email` and `password` for new users and only the latter two for existing users. For security, only usernames are stored in `local storage` while `tokens` are stored in memory. To ensure `sign out` across multiple open windows, a logout event triggers a `storage event listener` which clears tokens and usernames in the memory of the current window. 
- ##### Actions:
-  Ability to create an account. *(any User)*
-  Ability to sign in to an account. *(Registered Owner)*
-  Ability to sign out of an account. *(Registed Owner)*
#### Code Snippets
- The website features the ability to create, update and delete a code snippet. A snippet is based on the `snippet` model and each field is represented as either a `form` field or a `section` in an `article` depending on whether a code snippet is being edited or being featured. 
- ##### Actions:
-  Ability to create, edit and delete a code snippet. *(Registered Owner)*
- Ability to `fave` and `unfave` a code snippet. *(Registered User)*

#### Collections
- The website features the ability to group any and all existing code snippets into named collections aka `cheat sheets`. A collection is based on the `collection` model, which is a name and a list of snippets. Each field is represented as either a `form` field or a `header` followed by a `ul` depending on whether a collection is in edit or display mode. 
- ##### Actions:
-  Ability to create, edit and delete a named collection. *(Registered Owner)*
-  Ability to add and remove snippets to/from a collection. *(Registered Owner)*

#### Search
- `search_text` indices are attached to the title and description fields of the `snippets` cluster. The frontend UI of the search feature is designed to return snippet cards that match a query. Additionally, the ability to query by `tags` and `language` is enabled by filtering these existing fields in the database.
- ##### Actions:
 -  Ability to search code snippets created by others. *(any User)*
 - Ability to filter snippets by language. *(any User)*
 - Ability to filter snippets by tags. *(any User)*
  - Ability to copy snippets to the clipboard. *(any User)*
 -  Ability to `fave` or `unfave` snippet results from search. *(Registered User)*
 -  Ability to perform `crud` operations on snippet results from search. *(Registered Owner)*
 
### Features Left to Implement
- Add query params to all resources
- Extend query parser to parse more than one query at a time
- Optimize performance by dereferencing database records
- User profile page
- Ability to add friends
- Ability to share snippets

### Programs and Software
- [VSCode:](https://www.vscode.com/) Visual Studiio Code 2020.3.2 by [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/) is the IDE used to locally construct the project
- [Git:](https://git-scm.com/) Git is used as the version control system and is utilized via the WebStorm terminal to `commit` to Git and `push` to GitHub.
- [GitHub:](https://github.com/) GitHub is used to store the project's code and directory upon concurrent `push`es via Git.
- [Adobe InDesign:](https://www.adobe.com/sea/products/xd.html) Adobe InDesign is used to mock wireframes.

## Notes
- Styles are written in-component and merge both Chakra-format and Framer-motion-format to achieve desired UI results. This is done by declaring motion boxes in Typescript to accespt Motion-Framer's HTML style props and Chakra's.
- Pagination is only for search endpoint.
- Access Token is stored in memory. Only usernames are stored in local storage, along with storage event listener for key `app-logout` which is triggered on logout and ensures all windows are logged out while the tokens are stored in a `token blocklist` cluster.

### Code Testing
#### Frontend
##### Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO, PWA
[View Latest Results](https://lighthouse-vercel-lighthouse-integration.vercel.app/reports/cheathub-1rxs3u78h-israelias.vercel.app)
- Lighthouse via Vercel is used to test performace, which produces unique results on every `git push`. [lighthouse-badges](https://github.com/emazzotta/lighthouse-badges) is used to generate new badges for every deployment by installing ```npm i -g lighthouse-badges``` and pushing the new hashed url to the array of urls:
    ```
    lighthouse-badges 
    -o docs/badges -r 
    -u https://cheathub.vercel.app/ [... all other urls]
                       
   # Output to docs/badges
   # Badges will contain the respective
      average score(s) of all the urls 
      supplied, combined
    ```
- Lighthouse's metrics, namely Accessibility and Performance generate specific flags on each audit. Adjustments are made on each push that specifically address any issues. 
##### Accessibility Testing
- [ChromeVox Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromevox-classic-extensi/kgejglhpjiefppelpmljglcjbhoiplfn?hl=en) was used to ensure that screen-reader accessibility standards are met. This was done by walking through the entire project with the screen-reader plugin enabled. Various adjustments were made following these tests. Notably, the tab-index order of nav elements, and changing refining HTML5 semantic elements for `role` clarity.

##### Browser Testing

- Throughout the development of the project, in-browser dev tools were used to test for consistency across browsers. The browsers themselves were equally used for general use-case testing. The following browsers' per-device applications were accessed with an iPhone 11 Pro, MacBook Pro 15" and iPad Pro 12.9":
- Chrome Version: 83
- Firefox 82
- Opera 72
- Safari 14

## Deployment

- The project frontend is written in [Typescript]() developed with [React](https://reactjs.org/), bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and deployed with [Vercel](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment). The backend is written in [Python](), developed with [Flask]() to serve a restful database via [Mongo DB]().
